* C++ - CPP 
** Pages in this document 

 + [[file:Understanding-CPP.org][Understanding C++]] (C++ in deep)
   + Exploring C++ basic and advanced concepts and also modern C++
     features with both small and reproducible C++ sample programs and
     interactive examples taken from the CERN's ROOT/Cling REPL tool.

 + [[file:CPP-template-metaprogramming.org][Template Metaprogramming]]
   + also known as generic programming.

 + [[file:cpp-design-patterns.org][Design Patterns]]
   + Object Oriented Design Patterns + Generic Programming Design
     Patterns + Functional Programming.

 + [[file:cpp-reference-card.org][C++ and STL reference card]]
   * Concise reference of C++ standard template library showing main
     methods, collections (aka containters) and type signatures.

 + [[file:Cpp-C-Debuggers.org][C and C++ Debuggers Notes]]
   * Notes about C and C++ debuggers. Covered: GDB (GNU Debugger) and
     WinDBG (Windows Debugger).

 + [[file:bookmarks.org][Bookmarks]]
   + Bookmarks, tools, online tools, conference videos and so on.

 + [[file:Videos-and-conferences.org][Videos and Conferences]]

 + [[file:Interfacing-C-APIs-and-libraries.org][Interfacing C APIs and libraries]]
   + Examples about how to interface and create wrappers to C APIs or
     libraries in modern C++ or C++ >= C++11 and use STL containers
     with C-APIs.

 + [[file:Root-cern-repl.org][CERN's Root C++ REPL and CLING]]
   + Notes about the CERN's interactive interpereter based on
     Clang/LLVM for C++ where the user can type and evaluate C++ code,
     load libraries like shared libraries, boost libraries and and
     also test C++ with immediate feedback. ROOT is invaluable tool
     for learn, practicing C++ and create demonstrations.

 + [[file:sample-modern-cpp-programs.org][Sample programs in modern C++ style]]
   + Complete small C++ programs and proof-of-concepts.
