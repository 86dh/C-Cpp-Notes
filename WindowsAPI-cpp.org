* Windows API Programming Win32
** Idiosincrasies
 
  + Hungarian Notation
  + Non standard types:
    + LPSTRING, WORD, DWORD, BOOL, LPVOID ... 
  + Different Calling Conventions in the same OS: 
    + ~__stdcall~
    + ~__cdecl~
    + ~__fastcall~
  + Characters
    + 16-bits Unicode wide characters (wchar) instead of 8 bits
      Unicode UTF-8 which is common in most modern Unix-like Oses such
      as Linux, BSD and MacOSX.
  + Many string types
  + Many C-runtimes and entry points.
  + Functions has many parameters which makes them pretty complex. The
    only way to understand the API is to compile and run small
    specific examples.
  + Not all system calls are documented like open source OSes such as
    Linux or BSD. 



** Windows API Main Header Files

 + #include <windows.h>
 + #include <wchar.h> - Wide Characters - UTF16 chars 
 + #include <tchar.h>
 + #include <global.h>
 + #include <nsfbd.h>

** Windows API Runtime Libraries

 + kernel32.dll
   + Low level NTDLL wrappers. 
 + user32.dll
   + User interface primitives used by graphical programs with menus,
     toolboxes, prompts, windows ..
 + shell.dll
   + 
 + gdi32.dll
   + Basic drawing primitives.
 + ole32.dll
 + MSVCRT.DLL
   + Implementation of the C standard library stdlib.
 + advapi.dll
   + Contains functions for system-related tasks such as registry and
     registry handling.
 + ~WS_32.DLL~
   + Winsock2 library contains a socket implementation.
 + Ntdll.dll
   + Interface to Kernel. Not used by Windows programs directly.
 + Wininet.dll
   + Provides high level network APIs, for instance, HttpOpenRequest,
     FtpGetFile ...
