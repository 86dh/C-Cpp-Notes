<li>Brief: "A set of date-time libraries based on generic programming concepts."</li>
<li>Descr: "The motivation for this library comes from working with
and helping build several date-time libraries on several
projects. Date-time libraries provide fundamental infrastructure
for most development projects. However, most of them have
limitations in their ability to calculate, format, convert, or
perform some other functionality. For example, most libraries do
not correctly handle leap seconds, provide concepts such as
infinity, or provide the ability to use high resolution or
network time sources. These libraries also tend to be rigid in
their representation of dates and times. Thus customized policies
for a project or subproject are not possible."</li>

<li>Descr: "Boost.Accumulators is both a library for incremental statistical
computation as well as an extensible framework for incremental
calculation in general. The library deals primarily with the
concept of an accumulator, which is a primitive computational
entity that accepts data one sample at a time and maintains some
internal state. These accumulators may offload some of their
computations on other accumulators, on which they
depend. Accumulators are grouped within an accumulator
set. Boost.Accumulators resolves the inter-dependencies between
accumulators in a set and ensures that accumulators are processed
in the proper order."</li>

types in Multiprecision can be used with a wide selection of
basic mathematical operations, elementary transcendental
functions as well as the functions in Boost.Math. The
Multiprecision types can also interoperate with the built-in
types in C++ using clearly defined conversion rules. This allows
Boost.Multiprecision to be used for all kinds of mathematical
calculations involving integer, rational and floating-point types

single thread using a sort of cooperative scheduling (threads are
preemptively scheduled) - the running fiber decides explicitly when
it yields to allow another fiber to run (context switching). A
context switch between threads costs usually thousands of CPU
cycles on x86 compared to a fiber switch with less than 100

processors at a low development cost. To achieve maximum
performance, NSIMD mainly relies on the inline optimization pass
of the compiler. Therefore using any mainstream compiler such as
GCC, Clang, MSVC, XL C/C++, ICC and others with NSIMD will give
you a zero-cost SIMD abstraction library. To allow inlining, a lot
of code is placed in header files. Small functions such as
addition, multiplication, square root, etc, are all present in
header files whereas big functions such as I/O are put in source
files that are compiled as a .so/.dll library. NSIMD provides C89,
C++98, C++11 and C++14 APIs. All APIs allow writing generic
code. For the C API this is achieved through a thin layer of
macros; for the C++ APIs it is achieved using templates and
function overloading. The C++ API is split in two. The first part
is a C-like API with only function calls and direct type
definitions for SIMD types while the second one provides operator
overloading, higher level type definitions that allows
unrolling. C++11, C++14 APIs add for instance templated type

<li>"DASH is a C++ Template Library for Distributed Data Structures
with Support for Hierarchical Locality for HPC and Data-Driven
Science. Exascale systems are scheduled to become available in
the coming years and will be characterized by extreme scale and
a multilevel hierarchical organization. Efficient and
productive programming of these systems will be a challenge,
especially in the context of data-intensive
applications. Adopting the promising notion of Partitioned
Global Address Space (PGAS) programming the DASH project
develops a data-structure oriented C++ template library that
provides hierarchical PGAS-like abstractions for important data
containers (multidimensional arrays, lists, hash tables, etc.)
and allows a developer to control (and explicitly take
advantage of) the hierarchical data layout of global data
structures. In contrast to other PGAS approaches such as UPC,
DASH does not propose a new language or require compiler
support to realize global address space semantics. Instead,
operator overloading and other advanced C++ features are used
to provide the semantics of data residing in a global and
hierarchically partitioned address space based on a runtime
system with one-sided messaging primitives provided by MPI or
GASNet. As such, DASH can co-exist with parallel programming
models already in widespread use (like MPI) and developers can
take advantage of DASH by incrementally replacing existing data
structures with the implementation provided by DASH. Efficient
I/O directly to and from the hierarchical structures and
DASH-optimized algorithms such as map-reduce are also part of
the project. Two applications from molecular dynamics and
geoscience are driving the project and are adapted to use DASH
in the course of the project."</li>

<li><b>Jemalloc</b> - "jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation
that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency
support. jemalloc first came into use as the FreeBSD libc allocator
in 2005, and since then it has found its way into numerous
applications that rely on its predictable behavior. In 2010
jemalloc development efforts broadened to include developer support
features such as heap profiling and extensive monitoring/tuning
hooks. Modern jemalloc releases continue to be integrated back into
FreeBSD, and therefore versatility remains critical. Ongoing
development efforts trend toward making jemalloc among the best
allocators for a broad range of demanding applications, and
eliminating/mitigating weaknesses that have practical repercussions
for real world applications."

successfully on at least the following operating systems: AIX,
BSD/OS, DG/UX, Free/Net/OpenBSD, GNU/Hurd, HPUX, Irix, Linux,
MS-DOG, NeXT, OSF, SCO, Solaris, SunOS, Ultrix, Unixware, Windoze,

Boost.Python ideal for exposing 3rd-party libraries to
Python. The library's use of advanced metaprogramming techniques
simplifies its syntax for users, so that wrapping code takes on
the look of a kind of declarative interface definition language

mechanism behind this package is that functions and types are
registered in C++ code that is compiled into a dynamic

the Julia part of this package uses the data provided through a C
interface to generate functions accessible from Julia. The
functions are passed to Julia either as raw function pointers
(for regular C++ functions that don't need argument or return
type conversion) or std::functions (for lambda expressions and
automatic conversion of arguments and return types). The Julia

code that defines and populates the in memory structure."</li>
<li>"AJL supports stream parsing - This means you do not need to hold
the whole JSON representation in textual form in memory.  This
makes YAJL ideal for filtering projects, where you're converting
YAJL from one form to another (i.e. XML).  The included JSON
pretty printer is an example of such a filter program."</li>
<li>"YAJL is fast - Minimal memory copying is performed.  YAJL, when
possible, returns pointers into the client provided text
(i.e. for strings that have no embedded escape chars, hopefully
the common case).  I've put a lot of effort into profiling and
tuning performance, but I have ignored a couple possible
performance improvements to keep the interface clean, small, and

<li><a href="http://kifri.fri.uniza.sk/~chochlik/mirror-lib/html/">Mirror Reflection Utilities</a> - "The aim of the Mirror library is to
provide both compile-time and run-time meta-data describing C++
constructs like namespaces, types typedef-ined types, enums,
classes with their base classes, member variables, constructors,
member functions, etc. and to provide uniform and generic
interfaces for their introspection. Because standard C++ provides
only a very limited set of meta-information to build upon, a
potential drawback of this library is, that namespaces, types,
classes, etc. need to be registered before they can be
reflected. However Mirror tries to make the process of registering
simple by providing a set of user-friendly registering macros and
has the native and many of the other common types, classes,
templates and namespaces pre-registered. Furthermore, a portable
tool for automatic / semi-automatic registering is being worked
on. Once registered the meta-data can be reused in a large number
of situations. Mirror is designed with the principle of
stratification in mind and tries to be as less intrusive as
possible. New or existing classes do not need to be designed to
directly support Mirror and no Mirror-related code is necessary in
the class' definition, as far as some general guidelines are
followed. This allows you to do reflection even on third-party
code that you cannot modify."</li>

the following: It is part of a third party software package and;
Our build system would overwrite the changes we made; We don't
want to maintain our own version; Touching the internals would
require tremendous amount of recompilation of client codes, which
might not be desired."</li>

<li>"The only goal was to develop something that is as close as
python2.7 subprocess module in dealing with processes. Could not
find anything similar done for C++ and here we are. This library
had these design goals: Intuitive Interface. Using modern C++
features, made the API usage as simple as that in python in most
cases and even better in some (See pipiing example);
Correctness. Dealing with processes is not a simple job. It has
many low level details that needs to be taken care of. This
library takes care of dealing with those low level details
making it easier to launch processes; Error Handling. Currently
the error handling is achieved via the use of exceptions. It is
important that no errors are ignored silently. I am working
towards achieving this goal, but most of the error conditions
have been taken care of."</li>

<li><a href="https://icculus.org/physfs/">physfs</a> - "PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to
various archives. It is intended for use in video games, and the
design was somewhat inspired by Quake 3's file subsystem. The
programmer defines a "write directory" on the physical
filesystem. No file writing done through the PhysicsFS API can
leave that write directory, for security. For example, an embedded
scripting language cannot write outside of this path if it uses
PhysFS for all of its I/O, which means that untrusted scripts can
run more safely. Symbolic links can be disabled as well, for added
safety. For file reading, the programmer lists directories and
archives that form a "search path". Once the search path is
defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical
filesystem. This makes for easy access to ZIP files in the same
way as you access a file directly on the disk, and it makes it
easy to ship a new archive that will override a previous archive
on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you
platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available,
the user's home directory, where in the real filesystem your
program is running, etc."
